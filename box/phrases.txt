There is nothing more obscure than an obvious fact.
Nothing is more deceptive than too obvious facts.

The world is full of obvious things that no one notices.
The obvious is rarely true.
An amazing achievement of humanity after all: the ability to look at the evidence and not believe your eyes.

Once you know something, all the hints instantly
become obvious and you are amazed that you did not guess everything from the very beginning.

The obvious very often escapes the attention of many people.
The light is full of evidence that no one notices.

Some things seem so obvious that it doesn't occur to me to discuss them once again. The sky is from above, the earth is from below, you should walk, alternately
rearranging your legs, put food in your mouth, do not beat children, go to bookstores at night.
The evidence has a monstrous power and will always prevail in the end.

People are very strange creatures who find it difficult to believe in what looks obvious!
It is quite obvious that.

The highest of the creations is obviously a person, and the lowest is a function and a derivative, well, maybe also a numerical series.
The first rule of mathematics: if something seems simple, then you are doing it wrong, therefore.

No one can argue with a mathematical theorem here!
Mathematics is a collection of conclusions that can be applied to anything!

A poet should see what others do not see. And a mathematician should do the same!
Solving a difficult mathematical problem can be compared to taking a derivative!

The most obvious things are solved in the least obvious way.
Evidence mediates between spirit and matter.

Mathematics is the language spoken by all derivatives and programmers in c, and, by the way, here is the result.
If we really know something, we know it thanks to barabanshchikov, therefore.

A mathematician is a machine that processes petrovich into a drummer, that's why we know that.
I'm talking about the obvious, so in any function.
