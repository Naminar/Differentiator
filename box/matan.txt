The last two theorems show that the differentiability of a function at point x$_0$ and the existence of a derivative f(x$_0$)
are equivalent conditions and that each of them
is stronger than the continuity condition of the function at point x(0).
The proved theorem shows that the tangent in
the vicinity of the tangent point is located closer to the graph of the function than other straight lines.
The previously considered tangent with a finite angular coefficient f$_0$
x$_0$ is often called an inclined tangent. Prove it as an exercise.
Similarly, you can continue the function $\varphi$ if
it is set only in a half-cross. After possible additional definitions of the functions f(x), $\varphi$ in this way, it remains only
to apply theorem (1) to them.
If a function f(x) is such that its derivative f$_0$
exists on some neighborhood U(x$_0$) of a point x$_0$, then its differential df(x)=O(x)dx, x$\in$U(x$_0$).
The last formula for n > 2 as opposed to n = 1 is true
only if x is an independent variable. We show this in the case of n = 2. Let's find the expression of the second differential, assuming
that the function y = f(x) is twice differentiable at the point x$_0$, and its argument x is twice.
Derivatives and differentials of higher orders
differentiable function x = x(t) some independent variable t.
Lagrange's theorem is a special case of the theorem cauchy when g(x) = x.

The textbook corresponds to the program of the 1st year
$\MIPT$ and contains the theory of limits, differential calculus of functions of one and several variables, integral calculus of functions of one variable, numerical
and functional series and other topics. It is written on
the basis of lectures given for many years at $\MIPT$ 
by the author professor at $\MIPT$, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
Head of the Department of Theory of Functions
of the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
It is intended for students of physical mathematical and
engineering-physical specialties of universities with advanced
training in mathematics.
This textbook is written on the basis
of the author's lectures given to first-year students of the Moscow
Institute of physics and technology.
The author thanks professors B.I Golubov and S.A Telyakovsky, who read the manuscript and made a number of valuable comments that contributed to its improvement, as well
as A.V Polozov, an employee of the department, who took on the hard work of preparing the manuscript for publication.

It provides an accessible and fairly complete exposition of the main
sections of modern mathematical logic and many of its applications for the novice reader. Along with sections such as propositional logic, predicate calculus,
formal arithmetic and algorithm theory, it also covers
model theory and axiomatic set theory, which are absent from the book, which has served until now
the most complete manual on mathematical logic. It should be noted, however, that unlike book x-series, this book essentially does not touch on the intuitionistic and constructive directions of mathematical
logic.The presentation of the material in the book is clear and concise. The main text
is interspersed with a large number of examples and exercises. In the exercises, the author
also brought out some results, which are then used in the main text.
This, along with the conciseness of the presentation, contributed to reducing the size of the book with a very extensive content.

Considering theorem (2), we come to the conclusion that every nonempty numerical set has both upper and lower faces in the expanded set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.

There is at least one common
point for the segments of the system under
consideration by virtue of theorem (1). We show that there is no more
than one common point.
Two of the logical consequences indicated in the diagram
have already been established, the other two are proposed to prove to the reader as an exercise.

The manual consists of eight chapters and contains a detailed presentation
of the course of lectures given by the author to first-year students of $\MIPT$. A large number of examples illustrating the theoretical
material have been analyzed. A list of exercises for independent work is attached to each chapter.
It is intended for students of physics and mathematics and engineering physics majors studying mathematical analysis, as well as 
for teachers conducting classes in mathematical analysis.
